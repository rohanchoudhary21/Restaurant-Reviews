# Restaurant-Reviews

Restaurant Reviews Classification [Dec 2022]
Self Project
• Built a simple and effective NLP model that classifies reviews, given by 1000 customers in a restaurant,
into positive and negative reviews, providing valuable insights about the performance of the restaurant
• Utilized techniques such as Tokenization, Stopword removal, Stemming, and Bag-Of-Words using
libraries like pandas, re, nltk, and sklearn to preprocess the textual data and improve the model’s accuracy
• Employed the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to train the model and obtained an accuracy of 82%
